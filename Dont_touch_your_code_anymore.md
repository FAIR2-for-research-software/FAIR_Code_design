## Introduction

Research software is often based on a trial-error or trial-trial loops. You will often find yourself trying to rerun a code with different parameters to try different configuration of your code. So far what we have seen deals with the design of the code itself and how to make it cleaner, more readable and maintainable. BUT! what is you need to try something new by changing few parameters of your code? You will need to go and change the code itself! And it is very likely that you will do this a few times (or a lot!). Along the way, and unless you are able to track very well all your trials, you will probably loose track of some of them. In addition, modifying endlessly the code increase greatly the risk of introducing errors...
