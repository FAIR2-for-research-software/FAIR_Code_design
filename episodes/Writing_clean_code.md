## Python Enhancement Proposals and the Zen of Python

The Python Enhancement Proposals are documents that provide information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment. Some of them are also focusing on design and style: 

 - The main one is [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). It lays out rules to write clean code in Python.  
 - Docstrings convention are given in [PEP257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/).
 - The Zen of Python in [PEP20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) gives principle for Python's design. It is accesible in any python distribution with:

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```


## Readbility counts 

As Guido van Rossum (Python creator and Benevolent dictator for life) once said ''Code is read much more often than it is written''

While coding you may spend of a few hours (days) on a piece of code and when you will be done with it you will not write it again. Nevertheless there is a very high chance that you will read it again. If the piece of code is part of an on-going project you will have to remember what that code does and why you actually wrote it. Hence, readability counts! Remembering what a code does after a few weeks/months is not easy. **If you follow the standard guidelines it will greatly help you (and save you a lot of time!)**. 

In addition, if multiple people are looking at the code and developing with you, writing readable code is paramount. If people have to decipher your coding style before actually trying to understand what you are coding that will become very difficult for everybody. PEP8 provides a standardisation of the python coding style. 


## Explicit is better than implicit.

Naming convention

## Beautiful is better than ugly 

Code layout, indentation, maximum line length

## Errors should never pass silently....Unless explicitly silenced

## If the implementation is hard to explain, itâ€™s a bad idea...If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.


Comments and documentation strings


## Sparse is better than dense.

Whitespace


## Simple is better than complex...complex is better than complicated
