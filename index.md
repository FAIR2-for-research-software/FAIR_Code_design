This is a new lesson built with [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. 

Welcome to this training course on Code design!

This lecture on Code Design introduces essential principles and best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. 
It begins with the importance of good code design and goes through examples of non-optimally written code, trying to identify where we could make improvements.  We will then learn how we can write clean code, adhering to naming conventions, commenting, and following PEP 8 guidelines.
The lecture then explores some fundamental principles such as DRY, KISS or YAGNI that are useful to keep in mind when writing new code. Finally more hands-on activities will be proposed to explore code structuring and modularity, demonstrating how to organise code with functions and classes and how to make modules and packages. We will also explore how to create configuration files and command line interfaces. 


This course is aimed at researchers, including postgraduate research students, who write software (whether a few scripts or something more substantial) as part of their research and who want to follow best practices to make their code easier to develop, read and maintain.

This course is intended for researchers who use the Python programming language, but the basic concepts can be applied to other programming languages.
