:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Why should you know about code design?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Understand the 4 main concepts developed in this course: Maintainability, readability, reusability and scalibility

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Why should you care?

### A-  


### B- Designing your code is a continuous process

## Readability


## Reusability

## Maintainability

The maintainability of software depends on a few different factors. In general, it must be easy to understand the software (how it works, what it does, and why it does it the way it does), easy to find what needs to be change, easy to make changes and easy to check that the changes have not introduced any bugs.

Maintainable software allows you to quickly and easily:

- Fix a bug, without introducing a new bug as you do so
- Add new features, without introducing bugs as you do so
- Improve usability
- Increase performance
- Make a fix that prevents a bug from occurring in future
- Make changes to support new environments, operating systems or tools
- Bring new developers on board your project


It is defined by the 'IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology' as ''
The ease with which a software system or component can be modified to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environment''
